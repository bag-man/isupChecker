##Website Checker

If a website is down and you want to be notified as soon as it comes back up then this script makes that a whole lot easier!

Simply go to http://isup.me/www.websitethatsdown.com and isup.me will test if the site is down or not, my script will keep refreshing that page until the website is back up.

When the site comes back online it will redirect you to the website.

Enjoy!
